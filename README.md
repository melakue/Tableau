# Citi bike data analytics
## Background

The project is to analyze New York Citi Bike Program data, which is the largest bike sharing program in the United States and generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program. Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization but havenâ€™t had a tool to analyze the data and produce relevant reports to make data driven decision.  The task is to use tableau to build a set of data reports to provide answers.


## Task

* Here are the questions that the city official need answer for and are answered by the project

  *	How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

  * By what percentage has total ridership grown?

  * How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

  * What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?

  * What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

  * Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? 

  * Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey?

  * Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey?

  * Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey 

  * Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

  * How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?

  * How does the average trip duration change by age?

  * What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

  * Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?

  * How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

  * Additionally, city officials would like to see the following visualizations:

  * A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
